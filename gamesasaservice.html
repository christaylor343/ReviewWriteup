With the introduction of GamePass and Playstation Now, the amount of subscriptions being pushed on consumers is
dramatically increasing. Even Google is looking to enter the space with Project Stream. On consoles, most people
are already paying for Xbox Live Gold and Playstation Plus for online priviliges and free monthly games. <br>
<br>
Personally, from the usage I have gotten, I've found GamePass to be more of a replacement of game rentals. Instead of
paying the local store for a couple days use, its 100's of games for a whole month. The value proposition is pretty 
strong, especially if you don't own a lot of games. I've used it for games I may have missed, or couldn't justify
getting at the time, and they just slipped from my mind. I do think that its a more temporary solution though,
I don't see myself subscribing for longer than a month or two before I'm done for a time.<br>
<br>
I do think that this is something that is going to change though. Something similar I think, to what Netflix
did for the streaming industry- original content. While both Gamepass and Playstation Now have exclusive content,
I think that these services are heading toward lots of new and original content, some that may only be on these
services, as in no physical or digital release otherwise. For the same reasons some people subscribe to Netflix
for Orange is the New Black, or Black Mirror. I think something similar will happen for these subscriptions.
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, no matter what happens with these subscription services, I would be confident to say, this is an
area that is new and exciting for all parties involved.
