<p> Fallout 76 might just be the most controversial release in recent years. It's been nothng but one bad thing 
after another. First an unimpressive release with some dated visuals and lacking performance. Then discovery of 
multiple bugs present in every single Bethesda game. False advertizing on the collector's edition of the game.
Lack of content, and copy-pasted ideas from previous games such as Skyrim.

Fallout 76 is the tipping point of what consumers are finding acceptable. It seems the whole Xbox One/PS4 generation
has been rife with games touted as incomplete, from Destiny 1 and Destiny 2, to games like Metal Gear V and No Man's Sky.
While many of these in my opinion, are definitely lacking in some areas I would have to say Fallout 76 takes the cake
in missing content and features. It is also one of the biggest showings of community outrage as many players have
voiced their outrage all over the internet. I think this is a good sign, as I think many developers and publishers
will want to avoid the outrage, such as Anthem has recieved in recent days for the same issues. Low content and bad performance.
I think it is clear that gamers will not accept these releases anymore, and I for one am glad.
