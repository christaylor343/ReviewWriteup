Forza Horizon 4 is probably the best arcade racing game on the market. I have had endless amounts of fun <br>
racing, drifting, and checking off all the boxes on completing the activities. The whole time I 've had a blast<br>
collecting and modifying dozens of cars. They make it so easy to find or make a tuning, find a paintjob, <br>
and make the vehicle your own. There is even a mechanic to level up the amount of experience and credits<br>
you get with your favorite cars.<br>

<br>
I had the pleasure of viewing the game on an Xbox One X and a nicely powered gaming PC and it is simply incredible.<br>
4k and HDR make the game pop and is a showpiece. 
<br>
<br>
The online functionality is seamless and well-integrated. Other players will zip by on their way to their own races and challenges<br>
and you can stop at anytime and do a 1 on 1 race, anytime, anywhere. If you're like me, I mostly play offline, <br>
and the offline CPU racers actually mimic other people on your friends list using their Drivatars, which is constantly learning. <br>
<br>
<br>
Overall, I think that the racing experience Horizon 4 provides speaks for itself and for right now, is the bar for which, <br>
I would measure other racing games by. The amount of constantly updating content, the player made customizations, <br>
and versatility of being anything from serious track-racing, to extreme off-road motorsports.</p>

<h3> Final Verdict: 5/5 </h3>
