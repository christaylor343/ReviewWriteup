<p> Crackdown 3 is a open-world sandbox action game that has received many comments of disappointment and
lack of excitement come release day. After spending some time with it, I can say that I think while it isn't
a masterpiece, I had a lot of fun with it, and even after beating the campaign, was hungry for more.
<br>
<br>

The process of leveling up the various skills (strength, driving, agility, etc) was very addicting. Leveling up always
led to new, badass abilities that made the combat fun. Getting to skills to pick-up and throw pretty much anything
or gaining the ability to transform the Agency vehicle kept me entertained for hours
<br>
<br>

While playing I did encounter several bugs, including some hilarious physics glitches one video is featured below.
I didn't encounter any game-breaking glitches, just a couple sound and physics mishaps that made me laugh more than
anything

<p>
Overall, I don't think I would spend $60 on this game, but a sale price of about $30 or so and this would be a no-brainer to 
keep occupied for a few weeks. Pending any DLC or free content annoucements, the game has enough content for a playthrough or two
and maybe some playing around with max level powers before getting bored. I think it woud be something worth revisiting again
one day</p>

<h3> Final Verdict: 3/5 </h3>
